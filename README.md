Welcome to DirectHW by coresystems GmbH

DirectHW is a software compatibility layer for Mac OS X. It provides a kernel driver and framework that emulates the most commonly used hardware access functions on x86 machines, such as:

	•	iopl
	•	inb, inw, inl, outb, outw, outl
	•	rdmsr, wrmsr
	•	mmap() of physical address space

This package was originally intended to get the coreboot® utilities running on Mac OS X. But you're encouraged to use it for many more opportunities.
